So, what is the announcement now? well this is Christmas :poggies: and we added three new commands ``!collect``, ``!checkcoins`` and a slash command ``/gift``. So, what\'s new in this? well the command collect will collect some coins and any user can exchange the coins with some gifts and they can send those gifts to their fellow friends and loved once. So, how to send them? use ``/gift <user> <gift>`` command to send the gift. After that? So, here is part where you guys have to help. Well to make it more fun I have added the special roles as follows\n1. Little Drummer Boy\n2. Rudolph\n3. Snowman\n4. Santa claus.\nThese are the roles you have to create in your respective servers so that once users reach the certain amount of points they can use ``!checkcoins`` command to check how many coins they have and how many gifts they sent and it will send the buttons which will be used to add those special roles and have fun(you can visit my server to know more about it or you can dm me in discord here is the username:\nChandrasekhar Pilla#9929\n). Remember that the roles are case sensitive so they should be exactly same(capitalization, spaces etc). aaaannndd... I guess that\'s it. I am trying to add the timeout feature to the bot soon so timed mutes are comming soon. Finally thanks for supporting me. I guess thats it and greeting.\n\n Thank you')
